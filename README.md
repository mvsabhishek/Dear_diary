# Dear Diary
A personal journal application

 There are three reasons why I developed this personal project:
 
 Firstly, I wanted to create a personal e-journal for myself. 
 Secondly, I wanted to learn and create a Django application with Class-based views. 
 And lastly, I wanted to explore elastic beanstalk on AWS and  deploy it in the cloud-environment for real-time use. 
 
 I was able to achieve the three goals in three weeks of time. I enjoyed the three weeks of great learning.
 
 The following are the components in the application:
 1. Login
 2. Signup
 3. View Journal Entries (Home Screen)
 4. Make an Entry
 5. Update an Entry
 6. Delete an Entry
 7. Search for an Entry based on: 
 - Title
 - Date
 - Date Range
 - Combination of title and date or title and date range.
 8. Logout
